# Calories Burned Prediction

Understanding calorie burn during physical activities is crucial for fitness enthusiasts and health-conscious individuals. This project focuses on predicting the number of calories burned during a training session using data about the training specifics and the individual trainee. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal was to build a robust predictive model that provides accurate insights into energy expenditure. These insights can help users tailor their workouts and nutrition plans effectively.

## Results
The best model performance was achieved using the **CatBoost Algorithm**, with the following metrics:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 9.79  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 7.40  
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** 0.88%  
- **RÂ² Score:** 0.9989
